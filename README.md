# ZMK config for a Ferris Sweep keyboard

This is my layout for a regular Ferris Sweep using the cradio shield.

## The ideas behind the layout

This is a general-purpose Dvorak layout featuring:

### No shifted keys besides alpha keys

We have to use layers to support all keys on a 34-key layout. 
I always struggled with shifted keys (like `:` and `;`) and keys on a
separate layer. You constantly use different modifier+key combinations, 
which messes up the flow.

That's why this layout only uses SHIFT for alpha keys. (Technically, you can 
use SHIFT on any key, and it will work, but you don't have to and should not.)


### Home row mods (ALT, CONTROL, GUI, SHIFT)

Coming from QMK (Moonlander), I was amazed at how uncomplicated and stable
the hold-tap behavior is in ZMK. No more accidental modifier+key presses when
rolling over the home row. And no delays either.


### No double tapping

As with everything, this comes down to taste. I like alternating keys and dislike
double tapping. 


### All key combinations are available 

It's easy to produce a layout that only supports some combinations
of modifiers and keys. I've been there. :-)

### Deviation from standard Dvorak

Because I type double quotes much more often then single quotes and colon much more often than
semicolon (VIM user here :-) ), I switched those keys.

## How to type certain symbols

- € `ALT+SHIFT+2`
- £ `ALT+3`
- § `ALT+6`
